# Purpose
The organization Didactia, and its website didactia.org, should at a finished state provide all people with the following:
## A network of knowledge
The corpus of Didactia will be the network of concepts, and their interconnected prerequisites. For all concepts, a list of prerequisites will be kept, each prerequisite with the reasoning behind it. This network will the be able to answer questions such as: "What do I need to know, to learn this?", "Why do I need to know this to learn that?", "What concepts can I learn given the concepts I already know?".
## A variety of practice
All concepts of the network should have different ways of looking at them. This means that for a concept, a way of learning that resonates with you, should be available.
## An ability for everyone
It is of great importance, that everyone should be heard, no single monolithic truth will be sought after. A new or an old way of looking at something, could save massive amounts of time for newcomers to the concept, there should rather be too many explanations that are not necessarily certifiable, than a single one that is.
### Learn a concept
Anyone should be able to learn any recorded concept, to be able to know all prerequisites, and through Didactia construct a linear learning plan with the goal of understanding the given concept.
### Explain a way of looking at a concept
Anyone should be able to formulate their way of looking at a concept, and be able to have a discussion based on their reasoning.
